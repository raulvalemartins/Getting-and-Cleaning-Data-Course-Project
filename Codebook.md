# Code Book of Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Part of Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

To know more about the original experimental study design please refer to the information in the readme file at https://github.com/raulvalemartins/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/master/README.md


Information in this codebook: 

Each observation in the final data set is the mean calculation of each data measure aggregated by the two first columns (Subject and Activity)

1. Information about the variables in the data of the tidy data

2. Information about the summary choices maded


## 1. Information about the variables in the data of the tidy data

### List of Columns:

Subject: This identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
Activity Label: activity name performed. It should be on the values: WALKING
, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING


The rest of the columns represent mean and standard deviation 3-axial signals in the X, Y, Z directions and by averaging the signals on the agle variable. The value is a numeric observation. They are:

## 2. Information about the summary choices maded
Each numeric observation represents the average of each variable for each activity and each subject combination.
